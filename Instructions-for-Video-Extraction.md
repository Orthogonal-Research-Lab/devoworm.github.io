**How to extract the frames from a video using VLC**

VLC media player (https://www.videolan.org/vlc/) has the ability to extract the frames from a video and will handle virtually anything you can throw at it. This tutorial will show you how.

       1. Create a folder to store your frames and copy the path to it. 

       2. Click Tools -> Preferences in VLC.

       3. Under “show settings”, click “all”.

       4. Under “Video”, select “Filters”. In the menu on the right, tick checkbox “Scene video filter”. Click on “save”.
 
       5. Expand “Filters” and select “Scene filter”. Modify the dialogue box on the right.

       6. Paste the path from earlier into “directory path prefix”. 

       7. Decide what proportion of the frames you want to export. A value of “1” extracts all frames in the video.

       8. Set image type as “jpg”. Image types such as “png” or “bmp” only sporadically provide usable files.

       9. Click “Save”.

      10. Open video in VLC. Right click, and choose “Run as Administrator”.

      11. Click Media -> Open Video and find your video. Patiently let the whole thing play.

      12. Click Tools -> Preferences. Under “show settings”, click “all”. Under “video”, select “filters”. Uncheck “Scene 
      video filter”. Click “Save”. This is so that VLC won’t generate thumbnails the next time you play a video.

      13. Open the folder you created earlier. The thumbnails should be there.
