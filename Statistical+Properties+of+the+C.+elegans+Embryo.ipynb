    "In the next three transformations, we find the intervals between divisions, and whether or not these divisions result in two daughter cells or a single cell. In matrix C, the counts reveal the count for replicate embryos present at a specific timepoint. A \"symmetric\" division would create two additional cells, while an \"asymmetric\" division would create a single additional cell. For example, an increase from \"4\" to \"6\" in the count for a particular column (embryo) at timepoint \"4\" means that a symmetric division occured between timepoint 3 and 4. \n",

E allows for us to identify events that represent cell division in a lineage as a binary (yes/no) version of C. "

There is a long tail with respect to this interval. As a vast majority of divisions occur within 3 time units, there are rare events which lead to intervals up to 10x this length. This suggests that lineage trees could have an unappreciated [scale-free](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scale-free_network) aspect to the generative yet deterministic unfolding across individuals."
