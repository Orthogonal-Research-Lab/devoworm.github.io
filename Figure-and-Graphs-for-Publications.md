**Figures and Graphs for Public Documents and Publications:**

Check all downloaded images for copyright. Many CC-BY images can be downloaded from commons.wikimedia.org (usually Wikipedia-related assets). Use citation in caption of figure such as "COURTESY: xxxx" or Photo credits: xxxxx.

Copyrighted images can be used for papers and book chapters if permissions are requested. Please check on the cost of reuse prior to requesting permissions. Blog posts and slideshows require a citation, but otherwise are okay.

All graphics (including schematics) should be saved at a minimum of 300dpi and in .png format (to avoid lossy noise). Graphs and low-detail schematics can be stored at a lower resolution, but should be upped for public presentations. 

When making schematics, please draw in PowerPoint. Use any canvas size you find useful, but please adhere to the previously mentioned resolution guidelines. The schematic should not overlap the edges of the canvas. When done, save .png version as well as the original template as a .ppt file. Files should be stored together in the same directory, or the .png can be stored in the same directory as a file shortcut to the .ppt file.

Images from books and websites can be adapted for publications or other purposes using the schematic guidelines. Images should be labelled with an attribution (e.g. Adapted from -----).

Try to color-blind proof figures whenever possible. For more information, please see:

Regarding the assembly of bibliographies: try to import references into an EndNote, Mendeley, or Zotero library. Dr. Richard Gordon has a set of macros for dynamic reference citation in manuscripts and other documents where references are numbered. 

Please also take a look at some of the tutorials associated with the [Reproducibility for Everybody](https://orthogonal-research-lab.github.io/reproducibility-website/) research group, particularly [Dr. Tracey Weissgerber's materials on making better graphs](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/1-uaQ0lQT86FEgbXvk3W_WsmxAXK6MfgM), [Dr. Diep Ganguly's materials on Bioinformatics](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1LmkXr3SALatzwHqJ3SaZne8Mkq-f2DW_lA5xvHpE7T8/edit), and [Dr. Bradly Alicea's materials on explainable methods](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1yclB71zI4EAD4BPr-HjMAuTHpyOZXCLlnzEesFI_EEU/edit).
